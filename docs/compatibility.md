# Compatibility

The following lists indicates the support status of a repo in GOV.UK Docker.

- ✅ - can successfully run tests; can successfully start and interact with the app (if applicable).
- ⚠  - partially supported; the comments should explain what does/not work.
- ❌ - not supported; it should be possible to add support, unless the comments say otherwise.
